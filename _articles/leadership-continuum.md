## **Tells**

### **The leader makes a decision and announces it**

This sort of leader tells the team what to do, without involving them or considering their opinions. The leader identifies the problem, comes up with the solution and instructs the team to implement it. It’s about focusing on the task and getting the task done.

**Benefits:**

* Decisions can be made quickly
* Clear accountability
* No politics or disputes during the decision making process.

**Drawbacks:**

* The leader does not make full use of the team's skills or knowledge
* The leader may miss things picked up by other team members
* Does not develop or grow team members.

## Sells

### The manager sells their decision to the team

The leader still takes full responsibility for the decision making process, identifying problems and developing solutions without input from the team. However, once the decision has been taken, they make an effort to get the team on board, emphasising its benefits and addressing  objections.

The leader is aware that there may be discontent within the group and is making an effort to address it, but is not yet willing to give up control over the decision-making process.

**Benefits:**

* The leader still has full control, so decisions can be made quickly with little room for politics or diversion
* The decision may be more readily accepted if the leader explains the  the decision and sells its benefits.

**Drawbacks:**

* Team members have no say in the process, leading to frustration about decisions being taken behind closed doors.
* The leader doesn't give the team the chance to highlight issues that may not have been considered.

## Suggests

### The manager presents their decision and invites questions

The leader continues to have control over the decision-making process – they identify the problem and create solutions. However, once this is done the leader invites the team to ask questions, giving a full explanation so they are aware of the context and consequences.

Team members may influence the leader somewhat, as their questions dig into the problem and the leaders' confidence in the solution. This is the first step in two-way communication between the leader and team.

Drawbacks

## Tests – the manager invites discussion

A manager at this stage on the continuum has already identified the approach they want to take but is aware that their team could influence it and would often ‘test’ out their ideas with the team. At this stage, the team will start to feel more involved and more motivated.

## Selects – the leader starts to include the team

At this stage you’ll start to see leadership behaviour becoming more apparent. Here the leader is working with their team, presenting them with situations or challenges and whilst they might guide them the purpose of this approach to generate discussion with the leader deciding on the final approach.

## Consults – the leader starts to consult with their team

The Leader in you is beginning to show, your empowering your team to work with you to look at challenges, to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. You will of course still set the boundaries to work within but your team will start to take ownership and accountability.

## Joins – the leader is working alongside their team

As you join with your team you’ll find that they take responsibility. They’ll solve their own problems, they’ll work with you, not for you and will all be driving for the same desired result.
