<p>This is a comprehensive summary of desirable traits and attributes for effective leadership. Leadership can be an intangible concept and this model attempts to define some key characteristics which give a benchmark to strive towards.</p>

<p>This can be used as a self-assessment tool to assess your own attributes in relation to what is recognised as good practice. For example, it enables you to ask yourself ‚ÄòTo what extent do I inspire others? What can I do to develop that?‚Äô</p>

<p>This framework could also be used as the basis for feedback from your team members, colleagues and line manager - you could give them the framework and ask them, ‚ÄòWhat should I stop, start, and continue‚Äô.</p>
